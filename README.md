# Newsflash
## Neovim is the vim and arch is the base.

Experimenting with this setup instead of alpine+vim.
I think it is starting up a little quicker ...?

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whatbirdisthat/container-vim-yavin
make build
sudo make install
```

## Running it

Then when you want to get down, type `yavin` in your bash.

To get the nerdtree, hit `\n` and that brings up the "explorer pane" and like that.
